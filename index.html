        Harm we are causing

        <!-- TODO: Update the text with your own -->

        Over 1 million marine animals are killed because of plastic each year and there are over 75 million tons of plastic around the world. Pesticides and nutrients that are used for agriculture are washing up into waters which results in marine plants and shellfish to die. Sewage discharge also ends up into the ocean and pollutes it. Ocean pollution not only harms the animals but can harm us too. At one point they can close down the beaches just because ocean water becomes unsafe for us. Overfishing can also cause the oceans to die.

        Why?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Many marine animals are being affected by underwater pollution. Plastic bottles, bags, and many other items that we litter get dragged into the ocean and cause them to be harmed and either get injured or die. Oceans cover the most of  earth and about 50-80% of life is found underwater in the ocean. One of our main sources of food comes from these underwater animals of different species of fish. If the fish are polluted and the environment they are living in is polluted then, we most likely would be eating polluted food which is unhealthy for our body. Oceans that have living creatures in them help absorb carbon dioxide from land and help reduce the impact of climate change, if the ocean was dead then there would be harsher climate change effects. The ocean helps produce most of the oxygen we breathe and absorbs 50 times that amount of carbon dioxide. Without the help of a living ocean we would be having severe climate changes (it gets much warmer) and there would be more people encountering respiratory diseases due to the heat, air pollution,and smog.

         The actions we are doing affects the oceans and how we have to start being more responsible because if not, then the ocean will turn on us.
